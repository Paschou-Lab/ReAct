This Simulator generates individual level genotypes in plink .tped and .tfam files under a Balding-Nichols model. 

**To get summary statistics to run ReACt, you will need to install [plink](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/) and use command --assoc or --logistic to get the summary statistics to be used as input.**
